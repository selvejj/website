# Selvejj

Selvejj brings the powerful features of the [Jujutsu Version Control System](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/) to
JetBrains IDEs (Intellij, PyCharm and
others). It hooks into native VCS integration so you can keep using the same interface as with Git.

Selvejj treats `jj` repositories as first-class. You do not need co-located Git repositories.

**Selvejj is currently in pre-release and far from feature complete.**
